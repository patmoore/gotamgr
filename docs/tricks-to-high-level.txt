tricks for a high level A step by step guide in 14 steps.

1. slam dunk as much hits on challenges you can with naked ss and your

weakest att (level boost per hit not damage done)

takes a average of 60 hits on a challenge to rise one level until level 100 -

average of 135/140 hits on a challenge to rise a level once between

level 280 and 300) and more every so much levels

2. separate your level boost actions over 750 levels:

3. rise above level 100 with only challenge hits and the upgrades of the

four buildings of you best att (battle/trade/intrigue) you need to craft

from for ava camps and the 5 upgrades from the alchemist to boost

adventures with 10%

4. above level 100 start to play all quest volumes at once untill you reach

chapter four of volume 3/4/and you - you stop playing volume 3/4/you

to save them for after level 500

5. above level 200 start upgrade the 3 faith buildings plus the

siege works

6. above level 300 start to upgrade all fealtybuildings

7. above level 400 start to upgrade stables/tourney arena/alchemist guild

8. above level 500 start to play quest volume 3/4/you again

9. wait untill you have atleast 100 cmp before you upgrade upgrades that

have points connected with your weakest att choise

10. wait untill you have all adventures of volume 1 unlockt then sell all items

in the shop and play all adventures you wil be playing a lot in the

future just to claim it all once so you wil have all items that need selling

in the beginning of your sell list then craft and buy all non perm ss

decired

11. in your party play with all non perm ss to get them to rank 17 (15 to % or

30 to battle/trade/intrique) kick them out to rank the next commen

uncommen/rare ss (walking dead) and keep them comming

12. if you diferent adventures running at the same time - to get a easy

oversite of the running times of those adventures - from the first 5

in your list chose one in each adventure group

13. once you finisht your upgrades and start to craft put priority on crafting

for challenges before camps or personal crafting keep hitting on the

challenges with a naked ss and don't get more then 80/99 on

battle or trade or intrique until you are over 100 cmp serius don't !!!

once you got above 100 cmp slowly upgrade the upgades that have

points conected with your weakest att choise

14. don't upgrade the buildings that only have points for your weakest att

choise but you can start to upgrade them once you are close to 150 cmp

its ok to upgrade a few to craft but as few as possible the harder you hit

on a challenge the less hits that challenge provides
