Are you overlooking  the best adventures?
 
I've compiled a list of the top 7 "don't miss" adventures that should stay on your to do list.  There IS a "Best" for every level!
 
Run Adventure parties for these items, and your silver will soon overflow. These are key adventures- easter eggs amongst the others. All others have rewards worth much less, so check this list every time you level up to see which adventure will bring in the silver stags.
