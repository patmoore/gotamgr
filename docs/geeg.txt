GEEG- the Great Evolution for End Game is a strategy developed by leadership just for us.   Because of the awesomeness of our members, We have decided to make a big move towards 'End game'. Meaning, we want to help all of our lower level players to obtain all houses, and help all of our members to quickly gain 150 CP.
 
We proved that we can build level 20 camps.  Now we need to fill them all with 50 ss each, per member, and be as strong as we can be.
 
 *** This is for alliance info only**** top secret*****
 
Do not upgrade Trade buildings or equip anything with trade gear. All trade is to be 0.
 
On BQ's- use non trade ss, with 0 trade stats (1 or 2 is ok, but try for 0)
 
This is our magic speed up.  Using the 100 or so members who do this and all of the BQ's between us.
 
For this to work, the ingredients are:
 
Fast RI's to reach basic goal (open all houses if you don't have them, or perm talents that you desire)(1 RI is fine if you have all that!)
 
Hitting BQ with lowest hits possible, using trade hits while trade stat is 0. Your BQ hits should range between 3 - 50 (occasional higher ok)
 
Then, on LAST RI:
  Lots of friends for constant BQ's (it will help that we are all doing this) Friend everyone in the alliance.
 
To Prepare:
So, start gathering a few hundred friends. Low level players make the best choice- more BQ's.
Start perming what you need to bring with you
If you have never RI'd pls read the guide on  Wikia & here in "files" (there are several) and ask questions
Get ready to be awesome.
 
 
STEP BY STEP GEEG  GUIDE:
 
1. (it started, so....)
 
2.    Perm SS & Equip you want to bring with you. (Post questions here if in doubt on what to perm) 
 
3.    Double Check to make sure your fave stuff won't be left behind! Perm, Double Check!) 
 
4.    Make BREAD & Mead constantly until we start! 
 
5.    Sell everything you don't want to bring, buy peerless SS to perm (if you have gold) [the more SS you start with, the more BQ's you can do right away. IMportant to have as many as you can afford to. Once you have a good collection they will do you for all future RI's:)  (I have 60 perm) 
 
6.  Equip your best seals on best perm equipment. check with Marq for advice on Seals & Equipment. he has a chat for that.
 
7.  Friends! Each of us needs hundreds of friends. We will all be low level, so we will all offer tons of BQ's to each other. Friend everyone in the alliance.  Also look on war map for low but active alliances to friend their members. You are looking for low level actives who will likely give you lots of bq's. 500 is a good goal. It is worth spending some hard game hours on this, it is how you will level faster than the rest of Westeros. Not everyone has this commitment. We Do.
 
 
GEEG DAY
 
1.  You have done all of the above preparation, you are ready to RI. So...... RI!
 
            A. Always Choose lvl 13 Talent to Perm (that opens the Fealty Building)Until you have
                them all. 
 
           B. Choose your house, you should open all,   LAST should be GREYJOY , we want most to     
               end up there, for the faster adventures & 14% Harass bonus.  
 
 
2.      Remember- we want the HIGHEST NUMBER OF HITS POSSIBLE so use low ss with low with low equip  
           EACH HIT  GIVES    YOU  LEVEL UP POINTS.  
 
3.  We want to avoid ANYTHING that adds strength to your hits. All of our BQ's  should harvest lots
     of hits for all.
 
4.  If you have friends outside the alliance who hog the BQ's, please remove them for now. You can
     add them back later.
 
5.  VOLUME 1 is the only one to work through. When you hit the RI quest, do it!
 
6. Everyone is to end up with all houses open, and in Stark if possible.
 
7. For those who already have all open, perm talents like Faster Units  (stark), or Extra CP (1 pt in each house). those are the best long term perms worth doing.
 
8. Only lvl up buildings up to 1000 silver, then move to next building. Counting house to lvl 5 first.
 
Lets do this as quickly as possible. We will keep going until all ( or mostly) done. THEN we move to Stage 3:
 
THE GREAT EVOLUTION:
 
1.  LAST RI:   House GREYJOY
 
2. Counting House to level 5 (i like the gold option for extra silver/capacity!)
 
3/  We will be using our CP for Adventures rather than Barters.
 They are faster, we will be using the speedup tactics for quests & adventures as an alliance.
Run adventure parties for High price items to sell in the shop.  
 
5.  Key adventures w high sell price rewards:
 
Vol. 1:
Lvl 10: Send the Sistermen Home        Biting Blade                   420s
Lvl 16: Find the Slum Smugglers         Rope Belt                      1265s
Lvl 18:  Redeem the Fallen Knights      Hardened Mace             1950s
Lvl 39: Resolve Masters Split              Scholar                           2800s
Lvl 77:  Douse the Burning Fields        Grand Hardened Mace   3600s
Lvl 100: Evacuate the Mountain Men   Grand Pack Horse           4680s
 
Vol. III:
Lvl 95:  Find the Lost Bride              Grand Pack Horse           4680s
 
Note: I have checked all of the top rewards for Volume I.  These are by far worth more than any other  adventure rewards .
 
 
 
6. You should have too many bQ's, if not - friend more people.
 
7. Now we hit BQ's with: Naked MC, Naked low SS with worst hit.
 
8. The Number of hits we all get will have us leveling up far faster than is possible by ourselves, or
     with trade buildings/points/equip etc. 
 
 
THIS IS OUR MAGIC FORMULA.
 
When we have  our CP, combined with our knowledge and ability to build our lvl 20's, we'll be pretty unstoppable. it takes discipline to build up everyone into 150 CP players. Let's do it!
 
~~FOR THE HONORABLE!~~
